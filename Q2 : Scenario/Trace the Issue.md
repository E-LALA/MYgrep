1. DNS Configuration Issue
------------------------------
Root Cause Confirmation:
- Check DNS Resolution with System DNS vs. Google DNS:
  - If DNS resolution is inconsistent, compare the results of 'dig' or 'nslookup' using both your system's DNS settings and Google's public DNS (8.8.8.8).
  
  Commands:
  #Using system DNS
  dig internal.example.com
  #Using Google DNS
  dig @8.8.8.8 internal.example.com
  
  Alternatively:
  #Using system DNS
  nslookup internal.example.com
  #Using Google DNS
  nslookup internal.example.com 8.8.8.8

- Explanation: If 'dig' or 'nslookup' shows that the domain resolves correctly with Google's DNS but fails with the system's DNS, it indicates that the DNS configuration on the system is likely the issue.

Fix:
- Fix DNS Settings:
  - If the DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf is incorrect, you can change it to use a reliable DNS service like Google's DNS.
  
  Command to check /etc/resolv.conf:
  cat /etc/resolv.conf
  
  To fix it:
  sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
  
  Add or update the DNS entries:
  nameserver 8.8.8.8
  nameserver 8.8.4.4
  
  To make it persistent (with systemd-resolved):
  sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
  Add the following DNS entries:
  DNS=8.8.8.8
  FallbackDNS=8.8.4.4
  Then restart systemd-resolved:
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
  
  For NetworkManager:
  sudo nmcli dev show | grep 'IP4.DNS'
  sudo nmcli con mod <connection-name> ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8"
  sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

2. Service Not Running
------------------------------
Root Cause Confirmation:
- Check if the Web Service is Running:
  - Use ss or netstat to confirm if the web service is listening on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS). This confirms whether the service is up and accepting connections.
  
  Commands:
  ss -tuln | grep 80   # Check if HTTP service is listening
  ss -tuln | grep 443  # Check if HTTPS service is listening

- Explanation: If there’s no output for the expected ports, the service may not be running or properly bound to those ports.

Fix:
- Restart the Web Service:
  - If the service isn’t running, restart it. The specific command will depend on which web service you're using (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
  
  For Apache:
  sudo systemctl restart apache2
  
  For Nginx:
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  
  Additional Step (if applicable):
  If you recently made configuration changes, reload the configuration without restarting the service:
  sudo systemctl reload apache2   # For Apache
  sudo systemctl reload nginx     # For Nginx

3. Firewall Blocking Connections
------------------------------
Root Cause Confirmation:
- Check Firewall Status:
  - Use ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) or iptables to see if firewall rules are blocking incoming traffic on ports 80 and 443. Check whether the firewall is blocking the service.
  
  Commands:
  sudo ufw status         # Check the status of UFW
  sudo iptables -L        # Check iptables rules
  
- Explanation: If these commands show that there are rules blocking traffic on ports 80 or 443, it suggests the firewall is causing the issue.

Fix:
- Allow HTTP and HTTPS Traffic:
  - If the firewall is blocking the required ports, you can allow the traffic.
  
  For UFW:
  sudo ufw allow 80  # Allow HTTP
  sudo ufw allow 443 # Allow HTTPS
  
  For iptables:
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT   # Allow HTTP
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT  # Allow HTTPS
  
  Persisting iptables Rules:
  sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

4. Network Routing Issues
------------------------------
Root Cause Confirmation:
- Check Routing Table and Network Interfaces:
  - Use ip route to check for any routing issues that might prevent access to internal.example.com. Additionally, check that the network interface is properly configured with ip addr or ifconfig.
  
  Commands:
  ip route show   # Check the routing table
  ip addr show    # Check IP addresses and network interfaces
  
- Explanation: If there are routing issues or if the expected network interface is missing or misconfigured, this could explain the connectivity issue.

Fix:
- Fix Routing Table or Network Interface:
  - If the routing table is misconfigured, update it using the ip route command:
  
  sudo ip route add default via <gateway-ip>    # Add a default route (replace <gateway-ip> with the correct gateway IP)
  
  If the network interface is down, bring it up:
  sudo ip link set <interface-name> up
  (Replace <interface-name> with the appropriate interface name, e.g., eth0 or ens33).

5. IP Address Conflict
------------------------------
Root Cause Confirmation:
- Check for IP Conflicts:
  - Run ping or arp to see if the IP resolved for internal.example.com is in conflict with another device on the network.
  
  Commands:
  ping -c 4 internal.example.com   # Check if the IP is responding
  arp -a                           # Show ARP table and check for duplicate IPs
  
- Explanation: If you see duplicate IPs in the ARP table or if ping shows unusual results (e.g., no reply from the expected IP), there could be an IP conflict.

Fix:
- Fix IP Conflict:
  - If an IP conflict is confirmed, resolve it by ensuring each device has a unique IP address. You can assign a new static IP to the affected system or release/renew the IP address if using DHCP.
  
  For static IP assignment:
  sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces   # On Debian-based systems, edit interfaces file
  
  Or use nmcli for NetworkManager-managed systems:
  sudo nmcli con mod <connection-name> ipv4.addresses <new-ip-address>/24
  sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
  
  If using DHCP, release and renew the IP:
  sudo dhclient -r   # Release the current IP
  sudo dhclient      # Renew the IP
